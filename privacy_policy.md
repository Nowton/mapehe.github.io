As on millions of other websites, Google Analytics is used on
mapehe.github.io (how Google Analytics collects and processes
data is explained [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)).
The recorded data includes, but is not limited to:

* The municipality you access this site from.
* How long you stayed.
* The kind of device you are using.

I collect this anonymous data to be able to make better decisions
about the content of this site (in other words, what kind of posts
get a lot of reads). The data is not transferred to third
parties. All my activity falls within the bounds of
[Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).
