title: RegEx 101 - A minimal introduction
---

I'm a mostly self-taught programmer. While, in my opinion, the best programmers are the ones that have learned the craft as passionate
hobbyists, there are downsides to the informal approach. Most notably, without a rigorous training, it's easy to
overlook entire topics; some of which could have proven really useful, if only had you stumbled upon them, or had the tenacity to
pour through a dense book. [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), or regexes to be casual, are one of these things.
Assuming you are a programmer, data scientist or anything like that: **If you don't know regular expressions, learn them.**
They are available in most languages, even in some software tools such as Microsoft Excel. *And they are often insanely useful.*

Regexes are used for pattern matching. What that means is exactly what it sounds like: You take a sequence of
characters, you define a pattern in regex and then the pieces of the sequence that match the defined pattern can be extracted.
The catch is that regexes are really powerful and allow you to efficiently find highly complicated patterns if necessary.

## Some increasingly complicated examples

Regexes are available in JavaScript, so it's possible to tinker with them right here;
this discussion will be far from comprehensive though. The first one will be a plain old search.

<div style="padding: 0.5cm;background-color: #ece9ff;text-align: center;font-family: monospace;">
    <p class="regex-ex" data-handle="sentence" data-original="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.">
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
    <input type="text" class="regex-in" data-handle="sentence" placeholder="Try typing a word e.g. fox" style="font-size:15pt">
</div>


What you often do with this kind of a simple search is substitution. You could, for example match a word in the above
sentence and replace it with something:

<div style="padding: 0.5cm;background-color: #ece9ff;text-align: center;font-family: monospace;">
    <p class="regex-exs" data-handle="sentence" data-original="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.">
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
    <input type="text" class="regex-sub" data-handle="sentence" placeholder="What to match" style="font-size:15pt">
    <input type="text" class="regex-rep" data-handle="sentence" placeholder="Replacement" style="font-size:15pt">
</div>

Alright, that's pretty lame, since this is a feature readily available in most word processors. To make things a bit more
exciting, let's throw in a few wildcards. I'll list some of them:
<div style="text-align:center;margin:0.5cm">
<table>
    <col width="130">
    <col width="200">
    <tr>
        <td height="50"> . </td>
        <td height="50"> any character </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td height="50"> [a-z] </td>
        <td height="50"> any letter from a to z </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td height="50"> [0-9] </td>
        <td height="50"> any number from 0 to 9</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

These wildcards are very useful if you are dealing with strings that have some regularity. I've put some nonsense words below, few patterns
you could try on them are `a.a`, `a[a-z]a` and `a[0-9]a` and then think why they produce certain results.

<div style="padding: 0.5cm;background-color: #ece9ff;text-align: center;font-family: monospace;">
    <p class="regex-ex" data-handle="aba" data-original="aba abc ada a1a a0a a!a.">
    aba abc ada a1a a0a a!a</p>
    <input type="text" class="regex-in" data-handle="aba" placeholder="Try typing e.g. a[0-9]a" style="font-size:15pt">
</div>

One of the most useful feature of regexes is their ability to handle repeats. For example `a+` will match `a`, `aa`, `aaa` and so on.
A great example of how this is useful is extracting whatever is in parentheses: When you enter `\(.+\)` below you'll get the desired match
(the parentheses have a special meaning in regex so you'll have to escape them with `\`).

<div style="padding: 0.5cm;background-color: #ece9ff;text-align: center;font-family: monospace;">
    <p class="regex-ex" data-handle="parentheses" data-original="Parentheses (always used in pairs) allow a writer to provide additional information">
    Parentheses (always used in pairs) allow a writer to provide additional information</p>
    <input type="text" class="regex-in" data-handle="parentheses" placeholder="Try typing \(.+\)" style="font-size:15pt">
</div>

What if we have two parenthesis. By default the regex will find the largest possible match, so if you type `\(.+\)` below, you'll match
*everything* that's between the parentheses, even if there would be a smaller match available. In order to specify that we want to
cut off at the smallest possible match, let's throw in a `?`, so the final regex is `\(.+?\)`. Try entering both and compare the results.
You can also go back to the nonsense, example above and compare e.g. `ad.+a` and `ad.+?a`.

<div style="padding: 0.5cm;background-color: #ece9ff;text-align: center;font-family: monospace;">
    <p class="regex-ex" data-handle="parentheses2" data-original="Parentheses (always used in pairs) allow a writer to provide additional information. Round brackets (also called parentheses, especially in American English) are mainly used to separate off information that isn’t essential to the meaning of the rest of the sentence.">
    Parentheses (always used in pairs) allow a writer to provide additional information. Round brackets (also called parentheses, especially in American English) are mainly used to separate off information that isn’t essential to the meaning of the rest of the sentence.
    </p>
    <input type="text" class="regex-in" data-handle="parentheses2" placeholder="Try typing \(.+?\)" style="font-size:15pt">
</div>

Another nice example is conditional matching. For example, `(a|b)c` will match anything that's `ac` *or* `bc`. You can also compose
the conditional expressions with the wildcards, for example `([0-9]|[aei])c` will match `*c`, where * is a number or one of the letters
a, e and i.

<div style="padding: 0.5cm;background-color: #ece9ff;text-align: center;font-family: monospace;">
    <p class="regex-ex" data-handle="cond" data-original="a4 24 ab c10 2c 4g 20g">a4 24 ab c10 2c 4g 20g</p>
    <input type="text" class="regex-in" data-handle="cond" placeholder="Try ([0-9]|a)[a-z]" style="font-size:15pt">
</div>

## Above and beyond

Now imagine how this functionality is useful in practice: If you're a data scientist, you often encounter data that's in an undesirable
format. For example, I personally dealt with a large `.csv` file the other day, which had this repeatedly occurring error I could easily
erase with regexes. As another example, imagine having to extract every URL from a text. That's kind of tedious thing to do by hand,
but [this excellent StackExchange answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6883094/3616581) provides a handy regex for doing that.
This text merely scratches the surface however; more comprehensive guides are available for many common languages, such as
[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

Another reason regexes are cool is that they are related to a field of mathematics known as
[automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and serve as an example of pretty theoretical math being useful in real life.
