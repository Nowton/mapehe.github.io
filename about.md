I've studied math and
I'm currently doing a PhD in statistics in Aalto University, Finland. I started this blog as a place to share my thoughts on
different technologies I work with or just happen to stumble upon; also, I find this site good for giving an occasional
introduction to some stuff I'm interested in. 

This site is forked from [an awesome repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Do check it out if
you'd like to have GitHub pages too.
